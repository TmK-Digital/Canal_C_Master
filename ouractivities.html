                    <p class="detail-p">This guide details some things it is important to know when you are part of the crew of a canal boat. It aims to help you get the boat and its crew through a week long cruise, with the minimum amount of damage to you, your crewmates or the canal :-). You don't have to read it before you come - we will make sure you know everything you need to know - but if you want to know what you are in for, the info is here.</p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Whistle Blasts</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        The captain is responsible for the boat at all times, although at various points he may delegate control to someone else - either a leader or a member. That person will be referred to henceforth as the "pilot". Narrowboats are up to 70ft long, which is a long way to shout, so the pilot communicates with the rest of the crew using a whistle. There are three signals, which are easy to remember because they rhyme:
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        <strong style="color:rgb(92, 92, 92);"> 1. Whistle One - Attention.</strong><br>
                        One blast is a warning or a signal that the pilot needs something or needs to alert you of some danger. If you are outside the boat look at the pilot as they may want you to do something (such as duck!). If a group of you are inside then send someone to go and see the pilot.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        <strong style="color:rgb(92, 92, 92);"> 2. Whistle Two - Mooring Crew</strong><br>
                        Two blasts means the boat is coming to a stop, and a group is needed to secure her to the bank.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        <strong style="color:rgb(92, 92, 92);"> 3. Whistle Three - Lock Party</strong><br>
                        Three blasts means that locks are coming up, and a group is needed to move the boat through the locks.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Cruising</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        Cruising along the canal usually includes plenty of opportunities to get grounded on the mud, or crash into the bank, bridges or any other boats which might come the other way. If you are steering, try and avoid these eventualities (help and instruction will be provided). If you are sitting in the front well, hands must not be trailed in the water as you cruise. The captain cannot see you, and if the boat gets too close to a bridge or the bank your hand could be crushed.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        For reasons of safety, no member is allowed to walk along the side of the boat or sit on the roof at the front of the boat. With the captain's permission, you can sit on the roof at the back.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        Any member can have a go at steering the boat at any time, as long as the captain agrees that it is safe in that stretch of the canal. This appeals to some people more than others :-). No-one is forced to drive, but we hope that everyone will at least have a go.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Tunnels</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        We will occasionally pass through tunnels, which can take up to half an hour to pass through, These are great fun but there are a couple of rules to remember, Everyone must be inside the boat or in the front well. (If you stand in the front well, please try to avoid standing in front of the headlight!) Also, everyone who is not inside the boat must wear a lifejacket.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Casting Off</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        When moored, the boat is held by a rope (or 'line') at each end. The ropes are tied either to mooring spikes, which are hammered into the ground, to bollards set into the canal bank, or to special hooks - known as "safety pins" because that's what they look like - that hook round the pilings (metal reinforced sides) at the edge of the canal. Casting off requires two people, one for each end of the boat. The first thing each person does is remove the mooring spike or safety pin (if present) and get to a position where they are holding the boat into the bank using the line.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        The captain will then ask one of the people holding a line to put that line on board and get onto the boat. The remaining person will then usually be asked to put their line on board and then push their end of the boat away from the bank before getting on. BEWARE - if you are pushing the boat out don't push it out too far before trying to get on or you could get rather wet!
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Mooring Up</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        When the time comes to moor up, the pilot will blow his or her whistle twice to indicate that a mooring crew is needed ("Whistle Two - Mooring Crew"). A mooring party consists of two people - one for each line. When the pilot brings the boat into the bank the two people will get off the boat, usually at the front, taking the front line with them. One will walk to the back of the boat to take the back line that the pilot will throw to them. It is important to always listen to the captain. If you are on a line, you should only pull the rope when the captain asks you to - the boat may need to be moved before being pulled into the bank and once it's in and stuck on the mud it's often difficult to get out again.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        Once in position, the lines must be secured. If there are bollards, or rings, use those. Otherwise, if the bank has pilings, use the safety pins. If neither of those is possible, use mooring spikes. These are hammered in, in front and behind the boat, and the lines tied to them. The spikes should be hammered in at an angle with their heads facing away from the boat and should be positioned on the canal side of the towpath, so that the lines do not cross the towpath. Then brightly-coloured mooring spike covers are placed over the mooring spikes, so people don't trip over them. If the edge of the canal is shallow it may not be possible to pull it in all the way to the bank. In this case a plank is used to get between the bank and the boat.
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Knots</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        There are two knots you will need to know for safely mooring a boat. The first is the round turn and two half hitches, which is used for tying boats to bollards or mooring spikes. The second is the cleat hitch, which is used for tying a line to a cleat, such as the one on the front of each boat. You will use this for rings or safety pins, where the rope passes through and then gets tied up back on the boat. Those two links lead to animated demonstrations of each knot. Why not try them at home?
                    </p>
                    <h4 style="color:#b64d54; font-weight:bold" class="title-head-three">Locks</h4>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        Locks are used for moving the boat from one level of the canal to another - i.e. going up and down hills. They consist of a box with gates on each end and a means of letting water in at the top (higher level) and out at the bottom (lower level).
                    </p>

                        Some Technical Terms
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        The best way to understand how a lock works is to try it out. Fortunately, you don't need to find a real one and waste 30,000 gallons of water, as there are some simulations on the web.
                    </p>
                    <p class="detail-p">
                        Here is an explanation of how a lock works. They don't use all the same terms we do (see above) but the idea is the same. That site has a simulation so you can try it out for yourself. They also have a simulation for staircase locks (locks where the exit gate of one is the entrance gate of another), which gives you a whole set of extra possibilities for things going wrong. However, these are rare on the UK canals.
